# mac-pi-plus
A Raspberry Pi 4 enclosure that closely resembles an Apple Macintosh Plus

An RPi4 enclosure I designed as a going-away present for a former supervisor. Designed by inspection from photos and specifications for a real Apple Macintosh Plus. Some details were simplified in order to make the design reasonably printable in PLA or PETG. Way too big for my tiny MPMDv1 printer, so printing was outsourced to Treatstock. Printed in PLA with 30% infill, results came out perfectly.

Front Apple logo designed to be fitted with LEDs in Apple rainbow coloration with careful potting using hot glue.
FDD slot altered to accept a MicroSD extender card connected to the installed RPi4.
Front button for power on/off via a Geekwork X735 v2.5 power control HAT.
Front potentiometer for controlling side-mounted speakers, driven by the RPi4 3.5mm audio jack.
Rear dual connectors for providing full HDMI connectors at rear of case, connected to the RPi4 MicroHDMI connecitons.
LCD is a Waveshare #18645, tcapacitive touch supported and driven via SDI.
Top button for optional features, didn't get to implementing due to time constraints.

Originally intended as a joke gift running MacOS9 via custom-compiled SheepShaver interpreter, but with an additional "OS disk" will run RetroPie just fine.
