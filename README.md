# mac-pi-plus
A Raspberry Pi 4 enclosure that closely resembles an Apple Macintosh Plus

An RPi4 enclosure I designed as a going-away present for a former supervisor. Designed by inspection from photos and specifications for a real Apple Macintosh Plus. Some details were simplified in order to make the design reasonably printable in PLA or PETG. Way too big for my tiny MPMDv1 printer, so printing was outsourced to Treatstock. Printed in PLA with 30% infill, results came out perfectly.
